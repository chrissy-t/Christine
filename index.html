<h1><i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i></h1><h6>by Stephen R. Covey<br/></h6>
<br/>
<p> In the 1989 <strong>self help book</strong>,<cite> <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i></cite>, Covey talks about basic, primary habits that are the fundamental principles for human effectiveness. He defines a habit as<dfn> <q>The intersection of knowledge, skill and desire.</q></dfn>
Covey explains that we must allow ourselves to undergo<strong> paradigm shifts</strong> so that we can change ourselves and how we see the world.</p>
<p>The first <i>three</i> habits in the book deal with self awareness and moving from a state of dependence to independence.</p>
<ul>

<p><li>Habit one:<i><strong> Be Proactive</strong></i> <br/> Covey discusses that we should use our self awareness to be <i>proactive</i> and take responsibility for our decisions and behaviour. We should not blame
  the world for our problems or let outside influences dictate our actions. Proactive people focus on things that they can actually change and are, therefore, more effective people. Our ability to chose and be the creative force of our own
life seperates us from animals and we should not go through life as a reactive person</li></p>

<p> <li>Habit two: <i><strong>Begin with the end in mind</strong></i><br/> Covey tells us that we should keep our destination in mind so that each day of our life contributes in
a meaningful way to the vision of your life as a whole. Only when we <i>begin with the end in mind</i> we can start to be truley effective in not only our own lives
but in a business perspective as well. This habit is based on principles of personal leadership. Being a good leader is about doing the right things and setting a clear <strong>vision</strong> for the organization. Leadership comes before
management.</li> </p>

<p><li>Habit three:<i><strong>Put things first</strong></i><br/> This habbit is <q>The personal fruit, the practical fulfillment of Habits 1 and 2.</q> Covey tells us that in order to manage ourselves effectively
   we must have the discipline to prioratize and put things first. All activities can be categorized based on what is <i>important</i> and not important. We need to reflect on these activities and schedule our priorities while
   having the willpower to do something when we may not want to do it.Covey advises us that we need to act according to our <i>values</i> rather than our desires.</li></p>
 </ul>
      <hr/>
<p><h3>A quote from<cite> The 7 Habbits of Highly Effective People</cite> that I found helpful:</h3><q><i>It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busyness of life, to work
   harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it's leaning against the wrong wall.</i></q></p>
<p>To me, this quote shows how people would often find themselves working or achieving victories that are not fullfuling. Sometimes we get so fixated on mundane
  things that are not truley valuable to us and and our drive to achieve our goal blinds us from the things that actually matter. As Covey stated in the book, when we have a clear
  understanding of what is <strong>important</strong> to us and create <i>our</i> <strong>own definition of success</strong>, we can have more <i>efficent</i> and fullfuling lives.</p>
